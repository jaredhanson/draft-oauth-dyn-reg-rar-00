Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism by which an authorization
   server can obtain end-user consent to permit dynamic registration of
   a client.  An OAuth 2.0 access token issued based on end-user consent
   can be used to limit the parties that can register a client.

Internet-DraOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Access usi  April 2020


1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines
   mechanisms for dynamically registering OAuth 2.0 clients with
   authorization servers.  An OAuth 2.0 access token can optionally be
   used to authorize calls to the client registration endpoint.
   However, the type and format of this token as well as the means by
   which the authorization server issues it are out of scope of
   [RFC7591].

   This specification defines a mechanism by which an authorization
   server can obtain end-user consent and issue an access token
   permitting dynamic client registration.
