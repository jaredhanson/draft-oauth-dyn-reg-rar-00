Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism by which an authorization
   server can obtain end-user consent to permit dynamic registration of
   a client.  An OAuth 2.0 access token issued based on end-user consent
   can be used to limit the parties that can register a client.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines a
   mechanism for dynamically registering OAuth 2.0 clients with
   authorization servers.  An OAuth 2.0 access token can optionally be
   used to authorize calls to the client registration endpoint.
   However, the type and format of this token as well as the means by
   which the authorization server issues it are out of scope of
   [RFC7591].

   This specification defines a mechanism using OAuth 2.0 Rich
   Authorization Requests [I-D.ietf-oauth-rar] by which an authorization
   server can obtain end-user consent to permit client registration.
   The details regarding the consent that was obtained can be
   communicated to the dynamic client registration endpoint, which can
   be used to limit the parties that can register a client as well as
   restrict allowable client metadata.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   TODO

2.  Authorization Data Type

   To make an authorization request for client registration, the client
   makes an authorization request as defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0
   Rich Authorization Requests [I-D.ietf-oauth-rar].

   This value of the "type" of the authorization object is
   "client_registration".

   The authorization object can contain any of the common data elements
   defined in Section 2.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-rar] or any of the client
   metadata fields defined in Section 2 of OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
   Registration Protocol [RFC7591].  The implementation and use of all
   fields is OPTIONAL, unless stated otherwise.

   For example, a client registration authorization object could contain
   the following fields:

3.  Obtaining Authorization

3.1.  Authorization Request

   In order to obtain authorization for dynamic registration of a
   client, the client makes an authorization request as described in
   Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-rar].  The "authorization_details"
   parameter includes a client registration authorization object as
   described in Section 2.

   For example, a client using the authorization code grant type would
   make the following authorization request:

   GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &state=af0ifjsldkj
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
       &authorization_details=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22client_registration
       %22%2C%22actions%22%3A%5B%22create%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22update%2
       2%5D%2C%22locations%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fserver.example.com%
       2Fregister%22%5D%2C%22redirect_uris%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fcli
       ent.example.org%2Fcallback%22%5D%7D%5D
   Host: server.example.com
